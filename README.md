# Purpose

This is a TypeScript-to-Move transpiler that allows developers to write Sui smart contracts using familiar JavaScript syntax.
It aims to lower the entry barrier for web developers who want to explore the Move ecosystem, enabling rapid prototyping and onboarding without deep knowledge of the Move language.
By combining decorators, classes, and typed structures, MoveJS generates clean, production-ready Move code — helping more developers build on Sui faster.
